# yt-player-kids
YouTube Kids doesn't have timer in web version, so I built this project for my kids.  

Cuz of search videos api and search channel videos api don't provide "madeForKids" status,  
I need to call search videos api then call get videos by video id api to get "madeForKids" status.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
